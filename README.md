The code simulates dynamics of biological neural networks using Nvidia CUDA. 
The network type is a synfire chain, which consists of groups of neurons wired sequentially in a feedforward way.
All neurons in group n send connections to all neurons in group n+1, which corresponds to perfect synfire chain topology.
There is also a population of interneurons providing inhibition to the network. For more details see description.pdf
